# Solutions to Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow

This repository contains my solutions to the coding exercises from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron which I will add as I go through the book.

To avoid duplicating the solutions available in the [book's repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2). I will sometimes use a different dataset or explore a different aspect of the problem. All datasets are referenced in the corresponding Jupyter notebooks and can be found in the datasets folder.
